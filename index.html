    <h2>About Us:</h2>
    <p>Today, 600 million Africans still donâ€™t have access to electricity, particularly in rural areas. In far too many parts
        of Africa, night-time economic activities are practically non-existent. Women cannot make productive use of their
        time to carry out the most basic household tasks. Children who help the women cannot study at night without proper
        light and complete their homework by candle light, an additional expense for parents. Moreover, without access to
        electricity, over 3.5 million Africans die every year from harmful pollutants or fires in the home produced by costly
        and toxic solid fuels.</p>
